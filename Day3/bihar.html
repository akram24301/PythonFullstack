    <h1>Bihar</h1>
    <p>Bihar (/bɪˈhɑːr/; Hindi pronunciation: [bɪˈɦaːr] ⓘ) is a state in Eastern India. It is the third largest state by population, the 12th largest by area, and the 15th largest by GDP in 2021.[10][11][12] Bihar borders Uttar Pradesh to its west, Nepal to the north, the northern part of West Bengal to the east, and Jharkhand to the south. Bihar is split by the river Ganges, which flows from west to east.[3] On 15 November 2000, southern Bihar was ceded to form the new state of Jharkhand.[13] Only 11.27% of the population of Bihar lives in urban areas as per a 2020 report.[14] Additionally, almost 58% of Biharis are below the age of 25, giving Bihar the highest proportion of young people of any Indian state.[15] The official language is Hindi, which shares official status alongside that of Urdu. The main native languages are Maithili, Magahi and Bhojpuri. But there are several other languages being spoken at smaller levels.

        In Ancient and Classical India, the area that is now Bihar was considered the centre of political and cultural power and as a haven of learning.[16] From Magadha arose India's first empire, the Maurya empire, as well as one of the world's most widely adhered-to religions: Buddhism.[17][failed verification] Magadha empires, notably under the Maurya and Gupta dynasties, unified large parts of South Asia under a central rule.[18] Another region of Bihar, Mithila, was an early centre of learning and the centre of the Videha kingdom.[19][20]</p>
